# Parent Dashboard: Conversation Summaries Feature

## Project Overview

This feature adds a dedicated "Chat Insights" tab to the parent dashboard where parents can view daily conversation summaries of their children's tutoring sessions with Klio AI. The summaries are presented in an intuitive sticky note style interface.

## Goals

- **Non-intrusive monitoring**: Allow parents to stay informed about their children's learning without invading privacy
- **Learning insights**: Provide valuable information about academic progress, struggles, and breakthroughs
- **Intuitive UX**: Use familiar sticky note metaphor for quick scanning and interaction
- **Privacy-first**: Only share learning insights, not detailed conversation content
- **Auto-cleanup**: Summaries self-delete after parent interaction or time expiration

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

**New Table: `parent_conversation_notifications`**
```sql
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- parent_id: UUID (Foreign Key to auth.users)
- child_id: UUID (Foreign Key to children)
- conversation_date: DATE
- summary_data: JSONB (structured summary content)
- status: VARCHAR ('unread', 'read', 'dismissed')
- expires_at: TIMESTAMP (auto-cleanup after 7 days)
- created_at/updated_at: TIMESTAMP
```

**Summary Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  childName: "Emma",
  sessionCount: 3,
  totalMinutes: 45,
  keyHighlights: [
    "‚úÖ Mastered fraction multiplication",
    "üí™ Completed Chapter 12 Assessment", 
    "ü§î Needed help with word problems"
  ],
  subjectsDiscussed: ["Math", "Science"],
  learningProgress: {
    problemsSolved: 8,
    correctAnswers: 6,
    newTopicsExplored: 1,
    struggledWith: ["Word problems"],
    masteredTopics: ["Fraction multiplication"]
  },
  materialsWorkedOn: [
    {
      title: "Chapter 12 Assessment",
      subject: "Math",
      progress: "completed"
    }
  ],
  engagementLevel: "high",
  sessionTimes: ["09:30-10:15", "14:00-14:30"],
  parentSuggestions: [
    "Consider extra practice with word problems",
    "Emma is ready for more challenging fraction work"
  ]
}
```

### Backend Components

#### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/parent/chat-insights` - Get conversation summaries for parent
- `POST /api/parent/chat-insights/:summaryId/mark-read` - Mark summary as read
- `DELETE /api/parent/chat-insights/:summaryId` - Delete summary
- `POST /api/parent/chat-insights/settings` - Update notification preferences

#### Services
1. **chatInsightsController.js** - Handle API requests
2. **conversationSummaryService.js** - Generate parent-friendly summaries
3. **Daily cron job** - Process previous day's conversations into summaries

#### Integration Points
- Leverage existing `chatHistoryService.js` for conversation summarization
- Use existing `conversation_summaries` table as data source
- Connect to existing parent authentication and child relationships

### Frontend Components

#### Navigation Integration
Add new tab to main dashboard navigation:
```
Dashboard | Schedule | Chat Insights
```

#### New Route Structure
```

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ StickyNotesSection (This Week)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ StudentSidebar (existing, for child filtering)
```

#### Sticky Note Design
- **Visual**: Colored sticky notes with rounded corners and shadows
- **Color coding**: Each child gets consistent color (using existing subject color system)
- **Compact info**: Child name, conversation count, top 2 highlights
- **Actions**: Mark read (‚úì), Delete (√ó), Expand for details
- **Responsive**: 4 cols desktop ‚Üí 3 cols tablet ‚Üí 2 cols mobile

## User Experience Flow

### For Parents
1. **Morning check**: Open dashboard, see new "Chat Insights" tab if children had conversations
2. **Quick scan**: View sticky notes showing which children had learning sessions
3. **Read highlights**: See key learning moments, struggles, breakthroughs
4. **Take action**: 
   - Mark as read to dismiss
   - Delete if not needed
   - Discuss with child over dinner ("I saw you worked on fractions yesterday!")
5. **Auto-cleanup**: Unread summaries auto-delete after 7 days

### For Children
- **No disruption**: Chat experience remains exactly the same
- **Privacy maintained**: Only learning insights shared, not conversation details
- **Opt-out option**: Can request parents not receive summaries (future feature)

## Technical Decisions

### Why Sticky Notes?
- **Familiar metaphor**: Parents understand sticky notes for reminders
- **Quick scanning**: Can see all children's activity at a glance
- **Visual organization**: Date-based grouping with color coding
- **Action-oriented**: Clear next steps (read, delete, discuss)

### Why Daily Summaries?
- **Not overwhelming**: One summary per child per day max
- **Meaningful content**: Only days with substantial learning activity
- **Privacy balance**: Insights without invasive monitoring
- **Timely relevance**: Recent enough to discuss with child

### Why 7-Day Auto-Delete?
- **Reduces clutter**: Keeps interface clean
- **Encourages engagement**: Parents check regularly or lose info
- **Privacy protection**: Limits data retention
- **Configurable**: Can be adjusted per parent preferences

## Data Privacy Considerations

### What's Included
