### Sprint 3: Content Processing Pipeline - OCR & LLM (Part 1) (2 Weeks)
**Goal**: Implement OCR for PDFs and Images, and initial LLM structuring (without full validation/review yet).

**Tasks**:
- BE/TL:
  - OCR Step:
    - Integrate pdfminer.six for PDF to text extraction.
    - Integrate OpenAI Vision API for Image to text.
    - Integrate Tesseract as a fallback for image OCR (consider complexity vs. OpenAI Vision reliability).
    - Develop logic to choose OCR method based on file type.

    - API endpoint to fetch processed (or pending review) content for a specific upload.
    - API endpoint to save edited/approved content.
- FE:
  - Develop a "Content Review & Edit" UI:
    - Display the categorized JSON output in an editable form (JSON â†’ form mapper).
    - Highlight fields that failed validation or are missing (if LLM couldn't fill them).
    - Allow parent to correct/add information.
    - "Save/Approve" button.
  - Integrate this UI into the post-upload flow or a separate "Pending Review" section.
- QA:

    - API endpoints to assign lessons (auto to current week, manual date, self-paced).
  - MCP Server Interface:
    - Design and implement read-only API endpoints for the tutor agent to access structured lessons and assignments (e.g., by child_id, subject_id, current date).
    - Consider security/authentication for this agent.
  - Analytics Data Aggregation:
    - Develop queries/functions to calculate: Avg score/subject, time-spent (requires grades data), mastery gaps (requires more definition on how "mastery" is determined, likely from grades or tutor interaction).
    - API endpoints to serve this aggregated data.
- FE:
  - Lesson Assignment UI:
    - Integrate assignment options into the content management flow (e.g., after approval or from a lesson list).

- BE/FE/TL:
  - Version History & Rollback (Stretch for MVP, but in PRD):
    - BE: Design data model changes or strategy for versioning lesson_json (e.g., audit table, or storing previous versions in an array). Implement rollback logic.
    - FE: UI to view version history and trigger rollback.
  - Performance optimization based on testing (e.g., optimize DB queries, processing pipeline speed).
  - Address any outstanding bugs.
  - Code cleanup and refactoring.
- QA:
  - Full regression testing.
  - Performance testing (Avg time to upload+save a lesson).
  - Usability testing for the entire workflow.
  - Test tutor response with correct lesson refs (requires coordination with tutor team/mocking).
- All:
  - Documentation updates (user guides, API docs).

**Deliverables**:
- A polished, performant, and well-tested MVP.
- Version history and rollback for content (if included).
- Meet or approach target success metrics.
- PRD Features Addressed: 5.6 (Version history and rollback), Goals & Success Metrics.

## Technology Stack Summary (as per PRD)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (OAuth email/password)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase, JSONB for lesson_json)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (bucket per user ideally, or structured)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, or Supabase Functions (Choice depends on team expertise and scaling needs for processing)
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js, Vue/Nuxt.js, or Angular (Choice depends on team expertise)
- **OCR**:
  - PDF: pdfminer.six
  - Image: OpenAI Vision API (Primary), Tesseract (Fallback)
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4o (Function Calling)
- **JSON Validation**: Ajv
- **Deployment**: Supabase Platform, Vercel/Netlify for FE, potentially separate hosting for BE workers if not using Supabase Functions.

## Key Assumptions & Risks
- **OpenAI API Costs & Rate Limits**: Processing many documents can become expensive. Rate limits need to be managed.
- **OCR Accuracy**: OCR isn't perfect. The quality of uploaded documents will significantly impact accuracy. Fallbacks and clear error messaging are important.
- **LLM Structuring Reliability (GPT-4o)**: While good, it might not always perfectly adhere to the schema or might hallucinate. The review/edit step is crucial. Prompt engineering will be iterative.
- **Performance of Processing Pipeline**: OCR and LLM calls can be slow. Asynchronous processing is essential. The "â‰¤ 90s" target for upload+save is ambitious and includes human review time if validation fails. The automated part needs to be much faster.
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to the MVP features. "Curriculum settings" per subject (5.3) is vague and could expand; for MVP, it might just be the subject name/description. "Mastery gaps" (5.8) needs clear definition.
- **Mobile Camera Capture Complexity**: Direct camera capture in a web app can have cross-browser/device inconsistencies. A simpler "upload photo from device" might be a safer MVP start if time is tight.
- **MCP Server "write tools"**: The PRD mentions "read/write tools". This plan focuses on read. Write tools for the tutor agent (e.g., tutor updating assignment status) would be a separate feature/epic.

## Success Metrics Tracking
- **Avg time to upload+save**: Implement logging for start of upload to final save (after review if any).
- **% of mandatory JSON fields auto-filled**: Track during LLM processing and after parent review (to see improvement).
- **Support tickets**: Requires a system for tracking support tickets post-launch.
- **Tutor responds with correct lesson ref**: Requires integration testing with the student-facing tutor.

This plan provides a structured approach. The PO and TL will need to refine task priorities within sprints based on team velocity and emerging challenges. Good luck!
