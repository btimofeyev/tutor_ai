 EduNest Project Execution Plan (2024) — Updated Progress
1. Database & Backend Setup ✅ Complete
 Created Supabase project

 Set up tables: children, subjects, child_subjects (join), lessons

 Wrote SQL schema, ran migrations

2. Node/Express API & Supabase Integration ✅ Complete
 Initialized Node/Express backend

 Integrated Supabase client for all DB operations

 Set up controllers & routes:

/api/children

/api/subjects (add, assign, remove, list per child)

/api/lessons (upload, save, list)

 Used multer for file uploads and cleanup

3. Authentication & Modern Frontend ✅ Complete
 Initialized Next.js App Router frontend (create-next-app)

 Integrated Supabase Auth (login, signup, session protection)

 Branded as EduNest (Apple/Notion-style design with Tailwind)

 Created landing, login, signup pages

 Used SessionContextProvider and API session headers

4. Dashboard UI & Core Flows ✅ Complete
 Left sidebar: lists all children/students, “Add Student” button

 Main area: shows selected child, grade, stats, assigned subjects, and recent lessons

 Assign/unassign subjects (with join table mapping for child_subject_id)

 All React .map keys and unique IDs handled (no more warnings)

5. Lesson Upload, OpenAI Parsing, and Approval ✅ Complete MVP
 “Add Lesson” form at bottom: parent picks subject (dropdown), uploads image (or PDF)

 Backend upload endpoint parses file via multer, checks fields, sends to OpenAI Vision API

 AI returns structured lesson JSON; temp file cleaned up

 Parent reviews, can edit, then “Approve & Save” (stored in Supabase, linked to mapping)

 New lesson instantly appears under the subject in dashboard

6. Defensive Coding & Error Handling ✅ Complete
 All endpoints check required fields; user gets friendly 400 error if missing

 Defensive code ensures no /lessons/undefined requests

 All lists use unique keys for React; data always includes the necessary mapping IDs

 Proper cleanup of temp files and robust try/catch on all upload/save handlers

7. Current Polished Flow ✅
 Secure login/signup

 Add/select student (child)

 Assign subjects; each assignment is uniquely mapped

 Add/upload lesson (image → AI → editable JSON → save)

 Lessons show under subject, with correct mapping and fast refresh

 UI is dynamic, modern, and readable

8. Next Steps / Polishing Ideas ⏳ (Optional/For Later)
 Lesson detail modal/drawer: Click lesson to see full content in a modal

 Support for multi-page PDFs: Convert and send each page to OpenAI

 Collaborators/multi-parent: Let multiple parents share a family dashboard

 Lesson tagging, archiving, or progress tracking

 Better dashboard stats: Track total assignments, objectives, etc.

 Notifications or email updates (optional)

 Onboarding improvements or guided setup

MVP STATUS:
Core product is working, clean, and robust—ready for demo, user feedback, or adding polish/features!
