## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env.local)
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000  # Backend API URL
```

### API Endpoints Used
- `POST /api/auth/child/login` - Child authentication
- `POST /api/tutor/chat` - Educational AI tutoring chat with GPT-5-nano and MCP context
- `GET /api/health` - Backend health check

### MCP Server Integration
The backend connects to an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides:
- Real-time access to student assignments and grades
- Lesson content with actual worksheet questions
- Performance analytics for targeted tutoring
- Smart recommendations based on completion status

### Educational Tutoring API Format
```javascript
// Request with chain-of-thought preservation
{
  message: "Help me with math problems",
  sessionHistory: [...previousMessages],
  previousResponseId: "response_12345" // For reasoning chain continuity
}

// Response with educational guidance
{
  success: true,
  response: "Let me help you with math step by step. First, can you tell me what kind of math problem you're working on?",
  responseId: "response_12346",
  timestamp: "2025-08-18T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Design System

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (runs on port 3001)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## Authentication Flow

### Child Login Process
1. Child enters username and PIN on LoginPage
2. Frontend sends POST request to `/api/auth/child/login`
3. Backend validates credentials and returns JWT tokens
4. Frontend stores tokens and child data in localStorage
5. App navigates to TutorPage with authenticated session

### Token Management
- **Access Token**: Short-lived (2 hours) for API requests
- **Refresh Token**: Long-lived (7 days) for token renewal
- **Session ID**: Database session tracking
- **Child Data**: Basic profile information

### Protected Routes
- All tutor functionality requires valid child authentication
- Automatic token validation on app initialization
- Logout clears all stored authentication data
