# Quick Upload Material Organization Guide

## Overview
The Quick Upload feature has been improved to better organize educational materials with proper categorization and structure.

## Material Types

### üìñ Lesson (Non-gradable)
- Teaching materials, presentations, instructional content
- Used for: Initial teaching of concepts, reference materials
- Examples: PowerPoints, teaching PDFs, instructional videos

### ‚úèÔ∏è Worksheet (Gradable)
- Practice problems, exercises, homework assignments
- Used for: Daily practice, homework, reinforcement activities
- Examples: Math problem sets, spelling practice, reading comprehension

### üìù Quiz (Gradable)
- Short assessments, quick checks for understanding
- Used for: Checking comprehension, weekly assessments
- Examples: Vocabulary quizzes, math fact checks, reading quizzes

### üìã Test (Gradable)
- Major assessments, exams, unit tests
- Used for: End of unit/chapter assessments, major evaluations
- Examples: Chapter tests, unit exams, midterms

### üìö Reading Material (Non-gradable)
- Books, articles, reference materials
- Used for: Assigned reading, research materials
- Examples: Chapter readings, articles, reference guides

### üìé Other (Non-gradable)
- Any other type of educational material
- Used for: Materials that don't fit other categories
- Examples: Field trip forms, project guidelines, supplementary materials

## Organization Structure

Materials are organized hierarchically:
```
Subject (e.g., Math)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Unit/Chapter (e.g., Chapter 1: Addition)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Materials grouped by type:
          - Lessons (teaching materials first)
          - Worksheets (practice materials)
          - Quizzes (assessments)
          - Tests (major evaluations)
          - Reading Materials
          - Other
```

## Best Practices

1. **File Naming**: Include descriptive names in your files
   - Good: "Math_Chapter3_Multiplication_Worksheet.pdf"
   - Good: "Science_Unit2_Quiz_Plants.pdf"

2. **Material Type Selection**:
   - Choose "Lesson" for teaching materials you'll use to introduce concepts
   - Choose "Worksheet" for practice materials students complete
   - Choose "Quiz" for short assessments (typically 10-20 questions)
   - Choose "Test" for major assessments (end of unit/chapter)

3. **Due Dates**:
   - Lessons: Usually no due date needed
   - Worksheets: Typically due the next day or within a few days
   - Quizzes: Often due at end of week
   - Tests: Usually scheduled in advance

4. **Bulk Operations**:
   - Select multiple files to apply the same subject/unit/type
   - Useful when uploading a whole unit's worth of materials

## Tips for Organization

1. **Upload by Unit**: Upload all materials for one unit at a time
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent file naming conventions
3. **Review Before Submit**: Check that all materials have correct:
   - Subject assignment
   - Unit/Chapter selection
   - Material type
   - Due date (for gradable items)

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Clear Learning Path**: Students see lessons first, then practice, then assessments
2. **Grade Tracking**: Gradable items (worksheets, quizzes, tests) are tracked separately
3. **Easy Navigation**: Materials grouped logically within each unit
4. **Flexible Organization**: Can accommodate different teaching styles and curricula
